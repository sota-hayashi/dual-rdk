# dual-rdk
Two Random Dot Kinematograms (RDKs) are presented simultaneously. One consists of white dots moving coherently in one direction, and the other consists of black dots moving coherently in another direction. Participants are asked to indicate the motion direction of the dot group that contains a larger number of dots by rotating a response bar.
